# SFML UI
A C++ GUI library initiative repository. It is a cross platform UI library framework to bring modularity in computer applications. The aim of project is to provide an beutiful, maintainable and feature rich framework for writing computer applications for `Linux`, `mac` and `windows` platforms.

# why I want to build this framework ?
Let's start with bit of background. So far I wrote applications for windows desktop which using `.NET`, and what I found creepy while coming to `Linux/UNIX` is that there is no good framework which is portable and as well as native. Hell yeah we have QT, wx, electron etc but some of them have some sort of limitations and some consume ram a lot. So I've planned to write a framework which gives proper structured project like `Android` and `Angular`, feature rich and extremely customisable like `HTML`. That's how it started.

# How the framework is gonna be built
As I told before I'm a beginner so I'm not gonna write everything from scratch. Everything of the framework is gonna be written in C/C++. Now lemme specify what and all I've included and decided to use so far in my project.
  - SFML.
  - Chaiscript.
  - FLEX AND BISON (for writing a template parser).
  - and may be some more open source libraries in future.

# The working style of framework
This framework project are going to be built on top of this frame work will have structure of `Angular` typescript project. In addition to that all the text/string are stored in seperate file like in `Android application` project. In short every good things from all other frameworks :p.

# status 
  - strcutre of SFML and Chaiscript module is written (things like window creation is possible inside chaiscript).
  - Currently working on template parser.
  - and learning SFML in depth.

# why this project is open sourced?
I'm still a beginner I seek help from you and everyone else. After all this is gonna be free software.

# LICENSE
GNU GPL v3 now.
